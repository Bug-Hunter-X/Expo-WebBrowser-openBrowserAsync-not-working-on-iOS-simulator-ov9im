# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync iOS Simulator Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` from the Expo library does not function correctly within an iOS simulator.  Instead of opening the URL within the app, as expected, it opens the URL in a new browser tab.

This behavior is inconsistent with how it works on Android emulators and physical devices.  The provided code shows a minimal example of the problem and a potential workaround.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the project on an iOS simulator using Expo Go or a similar tool.
4. Observe that tapping the button opens the URL in a separate browser tab, not within the app itself.

## Potential Workaround (bugSolution.js)

The workaround involves using a conditional statement to handle the iOS simulator environment differently. For instance, it might involve directing the user to a browser on the simulator. This is a temporary solution and might require user interaction. A more ideal approach would be a fix in the Expo library itself.

## Expected Behavior

The URL should open within the application, just like it does on Android.
